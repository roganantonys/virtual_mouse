1. In this repository you will find the code which is used to create a virtual mouse in basically we can create a virtual mouse using eye detection and finger detection etc,but in this code we are gonna create a virtual mouse using finger detection

2. To make this code work we need to import three packages (i)opencv (ii)mediapipe (iii)pyautogui 

3.opencv package used to open the video camera which is a basic requirement in finger detection

4.mediapipe package responsible for the finger detection

5.pyautogui package responsible for the moving , clicking functions of mouse

6.using the opencv we are going to access the video camera and using the mediapipe we are going to track the index finger and thumb finger once the index and thum finger comes close to each other using pyautogui we are implementing the clicking function.
